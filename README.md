# rock-paper-scissors

Nothing special to say, it's a simple javascript project to create a rock paper scissor game that will be played in the console.
*Revisit: Redid the game, now it's played somewhat normally instead of in console.
 It's far from perfect even in a project like this but it'll do, i don't wanna spend more time on it.
